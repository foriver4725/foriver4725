# Hi there 👋

I'm a third–year university student majoring in game development.  
I started programming after entering university and have since worked on many personal projects as well as team-based productions in a student [FUKKARU](https://github.com/FUKKARU) development circle.

### 🧰 Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** C / C++, C#, Python
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Others:** Git, shader development (learning), DirectX 12 (currently studying)

### 🎮 Development Philosophy
Rather than mastering a single tool or language, I prefer choosing the technology that best fits the project.  
I enjoy working on low-level systems, building core foundations, and writing clean, efficient, and high–performance code.

### 🚀 Interests
- Client-side programming  
- Engine development  
- Low-level systems and foundational architecture  
- Project–driven tool selection  

### 📩 Contact
Email is the most reliable way to reach me.  
Feel free to contact me anytime for collaboration, questions, or opportunities.

Thanks for visiting my profile! 😄
