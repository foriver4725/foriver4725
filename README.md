# Hi there 👋

I'm a third–year university student majoring in game development.  
I started programming after entering university and have since worked on many personal projects as well as team-based productions in a student [FUKKARU](https://github.com/FUKKARU) development circle.

### 🧰 Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** C / C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP  
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine  
- **Low-level / Graphics:** DirectX 12 (currently studying), shader development (learning)  
- **Art & DCC Tools:** Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Procreate, Maya, Blender, Houdini  
- **Others:** Git, general web fundamentals and backend experience

### 🎮 Development Philosophy
Rather than mastering a single tool or language, I prefer choosing the technology that best fits the project.  
I enjoy working on low-level systems, building core foundations, and writing clean, efficient, and high–performance code.

### 🚀 Interests
- Client-side programming  
- Engine development  
- Low-level systems and foundational architecture  
- Project–driven tool selection  

### 🎮 Favorite Games
- **Genshin Impact**  
- **Horror titles** (Ao Oni, Resident Evil, and more)
