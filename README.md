# Hi there 👋

I'm a third–year university student majoring in game development.  
I started programming after entering university and have since worked on many personal projects as well as team-based productions in a student “AAA” development circle.

### 🧰 Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** C / C++, C#, Python
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Others:** Git, shader development (learning), DirectX 12 (currently studying)

### 🎮 Development Philosophy
Rather than mastering a single tool or language, I prefer choosing the technology that best fits the project.  
I enjoy working on low-level systems, building core foundations, and writing clean, efficient, and high–performance code.

### 🚀 Interests
- Engine architecture  
- Graphics programming  
- Shader development  
- Performance optimization  
- Low-level memory and rendering systems  

Thanks for visiting my profile!  
Feel free to connect, collaborate, or reach out anytime 😄
